The game called "Ancient Blocks" allow you to try yourself as the constructorer of logic systems from easiest to really, really hard. Start from building simple logic gates as OR-gate, and finish with creating your own microprocessor or even more!

# Current state

The game is in a dev stage, frontend is still hasn't applied. All functionality can be checked by writing code as tests.
Backend part (gates logic and behavior) is ready (basic functionality) and demands only debugging.
